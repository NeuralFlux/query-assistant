q *
string
(query)
Required, passing user query. The detailed query syntax for parameter is explained here for a core BioThings API.
Example : _id:FOOD00951


fields
string
(query)

Optional, can be a comma-separated list to limit the fields returned from the object. If "fields=all", all available fields will be returned.
Note that it supports dot notation as well, e.g., you can pass "chebi.name". Default: "fields=all". The parameter "filter" is an alias for this parameter.
Default value : all


size
integer
(query)

Optional, the maximum number of matching hits to return (with a cap of 1000 at the moment). Default: 10. The combination of "size" and "from" parameters can be used to get paging for a large query.
Default value : 10


from
integer
(query)
	
Optional, the number of matching hits to skip, starting from 0. Default: 0.
Default value : 0


fetch_all
boolean
(query)

Optional, a boolean, which when TRUE, allows fast retrieval of all unsorted query hits. The return object contains a _scroll_id field, which when passed as a parameter to the query endpoint (see the scroll_id parameter), returns the next 1000 query results. Setting fetch_all = TRUE causes the results to be inherently unsorted, therefore the sort parameter is ignored. For more information, see examples using fetch_all for a core BioThings API. Default: FALSE.
Default value : false


scroll_id
string
(query)
	
Optional, a string containing the _scroll_id returned from a query request with fetch_all = TRUE. Supplying a valid scroll_id will return the next 1000 unordered results. If the next results are not obtained within 1 minute of the previous set of results, the scroll_id becomes stale, and a new one must be obtained with another query request with fetch_all = TRUE. All other parameters are ignored when the scroll_id parameter is supplied. For more information see examples using scroll_id for a core BioThings API.


sort
array[string]
(query)

Optional, the comma-separated fields to sort on. Prefix with "-" for descending order, otherwise in ascending order. Default: sort by matching scores in descending order.


facets
array[string]
(query)

Optional, a single field or comma-separated fields to return facets, can only be used on non-free text fields. E.g. “facets=chembl.molecule_properties.full_mwt”. See examples of faceted queries for a core BioThings API.


facet_size
integer
(query)

Optional, an integer (1 <= facet_size <= 1000) that specifies how many buckets to return in a faceted query.
Default value : 10


callback
string
(query)

Optional, you can pass a "callback" parameter to make a JSONP call.


dotfield
boolean
(query)

Optional, can be used to control the format of the returned object. If "dotfield" is true, the returned data object is returned flattened (no nested objects) using dotfield notation for key names. Default: false.
Default value : false


email
string
(query)

Optional, if you are regular users of our services, we encourage you to provide us an email, so that we can better track the usage or follow up with you.
